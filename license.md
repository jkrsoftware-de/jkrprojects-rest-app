# 🌏 Licensing-Informations about this Software-Product. 💬
 
All my public-accessible Software-Content aren't underlying any Software-License. It's Free-Software.

You can use my Code as you want — my only Wish is: mark me as Original-Creator of your Derivation. But you mustn't. :)

My Intention of creating/publishing Free-Software is to help our Public Society.
In this particular Case our newly-created "Computer-World". I mean everything regarding complex IT-Systems.
