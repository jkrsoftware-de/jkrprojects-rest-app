# REST-App for jkrprojects.de-Services.

> **No Tests written (yet)**:<br />
> Currently, I value more the Productivity of this REST-Microservice.<br />
> That means, everything is working fine for me, but I don't wrote any Tests yet.<br />
> The Systems are so simple developed, I believe, there is no Security Issue regarding this. ðŸ˜Š<br />
> My Contact Formular-System currently has no Captcha-Check, so that's the only System, that's attackable.<br />
> Hopefully it won't be abused, till I implemented a Captcha-Check in the Backend + Frontend.
